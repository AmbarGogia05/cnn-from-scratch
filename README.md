The aim of this project was to create a code-along style tutorial that could be followed by anyone who understands the basic working of a CNN and wishes to build one from scratch using Numpy. 
This aim is realized in the Jupyter notebook committed, where I have done my best to explain the math required throughout and provided a working code along with a fill-in-the-blank style tutorial.
Please note that some of the math may not render correctly, please try opening it in Google Colab as it is optimized for the same.
